* Authenticate users with email and password.
* Handled asyncronous task with Kotlin coroutine.
* Handled state management with view model.
* Handled data persistence with Room database.
* Observe and update UI state with LiveData and StateFlow.

## How to run
* 1. Ensure you have the latest android studio installed in your system [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
  2. Download the project as zip file or copy the github link.
  3. Unzip the file and open it with android studio and run.

## Notes
* I observed after authentication the user data wasn't persisted until I restart the device.
* Due to time constraint I couldn't write test but I did manual testing with my physical device.
